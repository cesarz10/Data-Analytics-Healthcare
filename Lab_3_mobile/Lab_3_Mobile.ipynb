    "Modern mobile phones come equipped with a variety of sensors that can be used to capture and analyze various aspects of the phone's environment. These sensors include accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, GPS receivers, microphones, cameras, and proximity sensors. These sensors can be used to gather data over a period of time and analyze how the phone's behaviour changes over time. \n",

    "Mobile phone sensors can be incredibly useful in a healthcare context, as they allow for the collection of real-time, high-quality data that can be used to monitor patients and track their progress over time. For example, accelerometers and gyroscopes can be used to track a patient's movements and detect changes in their activity levels, which can be useful in managing chronic conditions like Parkinson's disease. GPS receivers can be used to track a patient's location, which can be useful in cases where patients have cognitive impairments or are prone to wandering. Additionally, microphones can be used to monitor a patient's breathing patterns and detect signs of respiratory distress, while cameras can be used to monitor a patient's skin for signs of pressure ulcers. Overall, the use of mobile phone sensors in healthcare can help to improve patient outcomes, reduce the cost of care, and enable more personalized and effective treatment plans.\n",

    "These sensor data are inherently time series data because they capture information about changes in the phone's environment over time. In a time series context, these data points are arranged in chronological order, with each observation representing a snapshot of the phone's environment at a particular point in time. It is by analyzing these data points over time, researchers and developers can gain insights into how the phone's environment changes over time and how users interact with their devices. "

    "An univariate time series is a set of observations that measures changes in a single variable over time. In other words, it is a time series that tracks only one metric or data point over time. Univariate time series analysis involves analyzing the patterns and trends in this data over time, such as detecting seasonality, identifying trends, and forecasting future values. By focusing on a single variable, univariate time series analysis can provide valuable insights into the behavior of that variable over time, which can be useful for a wide range of applications.\n",
